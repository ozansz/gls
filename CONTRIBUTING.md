## Getting Started

1. Fork the project [github.com/ozansz/gls](https://github.com/ozansz/gls) to your own account
2. Clone the repository on your development machine

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/gls.git
```

3. Make sure the CLI builds flawlessly

```bash
cd gls
go build cmd/gls/main.go
```

## Contribution Flow

This is a outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

1. Select an issue to work on from [github.com/ozansz/gls/issues](https://github.com/ozansz/gls/issues), **OR** open an issue on the same page if you found another issue to fix, or have an idea to improve the project

2. Create a separate branch from `master` branch to base your work.

```bash
git checkout -b this-is-a-super-cool-feature
```

3. Work on your fix/implementation. Also please do proper commenting on your code where it may be hard for people to understand at first sight

4. Update the documentation (currently only the [README.md](README.md)) if needed

4. Push your changes to the branch you have created

5. Submit a pull request to the original repository. Please see [the section below](#opening-a-pull-request) section before opening your PR

### Opening a pull request

Please follow the below format while creating your pull request:

* **Title**: Make sure that your PR's title summarizes your contribution in a short simple sentence. Ex: "update installation section of documentation"

Note: Your PR title doesn't have to be the same as the title of the issue you're intended to fix, if you're fixing a specific issue in the PR.

* **Content**: We have a PR template which includes some related information about your implementation and fixes which make it easier for us to review your contribution. Please make sure to follow the template.
